<h3>Description</h3>
Users start a game where a set of 10 questions from larger library are randomly selected to answer. Users are given a set amount of time to answer a question, and are encouraged to answer quickly as the total points for answering the question correctly decreases as the timer counts down. The game also stores the high score for that session to encourage the user to play multiple times.
